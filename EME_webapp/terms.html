        </div>
        <p>
            The EME: Engineering Made Easy platform (“EME”) is an adaptive learning platform designed and managed by EME Nigeria to provide Nigerian engineering students and professionals with COREN and NUC-aligned educational resources. By accessing or using the EME platform, users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
            EME is a digital platform that delivers specialized learning content aligned with the standards of the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and the National Universities Commission (NUC). Its services are tailored to enhance academic and professional development for engineering learners in Nigeria. EME reserves the right to update or modify its content and services at any time to ensure relevance and quality.
        </p>


        <p>
            To use EME, individuals must be at least sixteen years old or of legal age in their jurisdiction. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account details and for using the platform solely for lawful and educational purposes. Any form of content duplication, redistribution, or modification without prior authorization is strictly prohibited. Users are also expected to refrain from activities that could disrupt or impair the functionality of the platform.
        All content, materials, and design elements on EME are the intellectual property of EME Nigeria or its licensed partners. Access to these materials is granted for personal educational use only, and any commercial or unauthorized use is prohibited. While the platform’s materials are developed in alignment with COREN and NUC standards, this does not imply official endorsement or guarantee of certification or job placement outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
        EME upholds users’ privacy by complying with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and related data laws. User data is processed responsibly and securely, as outlined in EME’s Privacy Policy. Although EME employs industry-standard security measures, it cannot guarantee absolute protection from unauthorized access or data breaches.
        Some of EME’s learning resources and services may require a paid subscription. All subscription fees, renewal procedures, and cancellation policies are clearly detailed on the platform. EME reserves the right to adjust pricing structures, with adequate notice provided to subscribers before any changes take effect.
        </p>

        <p>
        EME Nigeria may suspend or terminate user accounts that violate these Terms or engage in unlawful or harmful behavior. Upon termination, users lose access to the platform and related services. Users may also choose to terminate their accounts voluntarily by contacting EME’s support team.
        The platform and all its content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any warranties, whether express or implied. EME does not guarantee uninterrupted access, error-free operation, or specific learning outcomes. The company is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by Nigerian law, EME Nigeria shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or claims related to the platform’s use. These limitations apply to all users and circumstances unless otherwise restricted by applicable law.
        These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and any disputes arising from their interpretation or enforcement will be resolved under Nigerian legal processes and within the jurisdiction of Nigerian courts.
        EME reserves the right to amend or update these Terms at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes through email or in-app notifications, and continued use of the platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
        For inquiries, feedback, or concerns regarding these Terms and Conditions, users may contact EME Nigeria via email at owonibifavour@gmail.com or by phone at +234 814 161 6542.
        By continuing to use EME, users confirm that they have read, understood, and agreed to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
